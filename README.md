Data Structures & Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) repository! 
This repo is my personal space where I practice, learn, and implement DSA concepts in Java 🖥️ (and sometimes other languages).
 What's Inside?

🔹 Basic of Java - program 

🔹 Arrays – Searching, Sorting, and more

🔹 Strings – Palindrome, Anagrams, Substrings

🔹 Linked List – Singly, Doubly, and Circular

🔹 Stack & Queue – Implementations + Problems

🔹 Recursion & Backtracking – Classic challenges

🔹 Trees & Graphs – Traversals, BFS, DFS, MST, etc.

🔹 Dynamic Programming – Knapsack, LIS, Matrix Chain, etc.

🔹 Greedy Algorithms – Huffman Coding, Interval Scheduling

🔹 Advanced Topics – Tries, Heaps, Disjoint Set Union

🎯 Purpose

✔ Strengthen problem-solving skills 🧩
✔ Prepare for coding interviews & competitive programming ⚡
✔ Build a strong foundation in DSA concepts 💡
